### Homework Journal

I took the following steps while doing this exercise:

1. Clone the Homework repo
1. Create Directory for myself `CharlesHolbrow/`
1. I remember from "class" that Professor Van Troyer said that there was a journal template Reamde that I could copy to use as a starting point for my homework journal. I copied the readme from the Classwork repo in the first Homework directory, and made a commit
1. I realized that The `README.MD` that I copied was not the correct one, but I do not remember where it is. So I'm starting from scratch with this document.
1. Make another commit with the new `README.md`. Once this is done I will push and make a PR.
