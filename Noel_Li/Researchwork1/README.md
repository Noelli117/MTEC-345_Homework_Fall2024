### Song concept and introduction 

Song:Natyre's Bomb

GANTASMO: Daniel Joaquin Trujillo's AI music project (2018-2019)

Collaboration with Sarah Maynard

Aim: Raising awareness about environmental destruction and animal suffering

Theme: Animals witnessing habitat devastation

### Creative process: 1.Lyric  development, utlizing Chatgpt and Llama3.
                  2.Sound design:Audio sample collection: Natural sounds (whale songs, extinct species vocalizations).Human-made sounds (nuclear tests, gunfire, fracking. Sample processing with StableAudioã€‚
                  3.Stable Audio:StableAudio is an AI-powered audio generation tool developed by Stability AI. It's designed to create high-quality, original music and sound effects using artificial intelligence technology.
                  Core Architecture:
                  StableAudio likely uses a combination of advanced machine learning models, including:
                  Transformer-based models for sequence generation
                  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for high-quality output
                  Autoregressive models for sample-by-sample generation

### Transformer models introduction(I asked AI for this part):
1.Attention Mechanism:The core innovation of Transformers.
Allows the model to "focus" on the most relevant parts when processing an input sequence.
Analogy: When reading a long article, we pay special attention to key words and important paragraphs.

2.Self-Attention:
Each element in the input sequence can interact with all other elements in the same sequence.
Enables the model to capture complex relationships within the sequence.

3.Multi-Head Attention:
Performs multiple attention operations simultaneously.
Allows the model to understand the input from different perspectives.
Analogy: Observing an object from multiple angles.

.Positional Encoding:Since Transformers don't inherently process sequences like RNNs, additional position information is needed.
Adds a unique identifier to each position in the input sequence.

### Generative Adversial Networks(I asked AI for this):
How GANs Work:
1. The generator creates new data instances.
2. The discriminator evaluates these instances along with real data from the training set.
3. Both networks receive feedback and adjust:
    1.The generator aims to create more convincing outputs.
    2.The discriminator aims to get better at distinguishing real from fake.
4. This process continues, leading to improvement in both networks.
