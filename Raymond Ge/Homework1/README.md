# Homework1
### Getting Started
As I joined this course late, I had missed the first lecture so I navigated to the Canvas page and found the youtube page for recorded lectures. Upon reviewing the missed lecture, I emailed Professor Holbrow my Github username to be added to both the class materials and homework repositories. Upon gaining access to the repositories, I cloned both of them.
### README.md
Initially as I was watching the lecture video, I had followed along with what Professor Holbrow was writing in his markdown file, just some quick sentences. I had also gone through the process of creating a new branch (titled Homework1) and pushed it. Upon reviewing the documentation guidelines however, I had erased what I had in my markdown file and instead journaled the process of cloning, branching, and contributing to repositories using Github (as you are reading now).
