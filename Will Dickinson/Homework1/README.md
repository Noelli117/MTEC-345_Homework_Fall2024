# Homework 1


--

### Obtaining Access

The first task required of me in order to complete this assignment was obtaining write-access to our class's homework repository. To do this, I took the following steps:

 - Emailed my professor my Github username
 - Accepted the invite he sent me to collaborate on the repo

### Creating a Branch

I was then able to create a branch from the repository, which was required in order to ensure that any changes I made to its contents were not reflected in the main branch accessible by everyone in the class. Branching was carried out as follows:

 - Navigated to branch selector on Github desktop
 - Clicked "New Branch"
 - Named branch a combination of my own name and assignment number

All that was left to do after that was to create the content of the submission.

### Creating the Submission

It was necessary to create a valid path for this Readme within the repository, so that future assignments may follow in-convention. This was achieved as follows:

 - Created a folder labeled with my own name
 - Created a folder in that folder labeled "Homework1"
 - Created a README.md in that folder, which you are reading now
 - Populated the README with the steps required to complete the assignment in totality
