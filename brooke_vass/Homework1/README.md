Hi my name is Brooke, I am getting my B.F.A. in commercial dance at BOCO and a minor in Creative Coding. 

For this submission, I started with cloning the Homework Repo through my Github destop. Once it was cloned I created my folder under it with my name for Homework submissions, and then created my subfolder to start this submission. I had difficulty in figuring out creating the folders but did not use any external resources to figure it out. 

Overall, this is still something new to me and I am excited to learn more!
